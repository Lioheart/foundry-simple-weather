## Used modules

### Simple Calendar

Simple Weather heavily relies on [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) by [Vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren). Thank you for inspiration  and a simple API.

## Original Author

You can't easily tell, because this is a rebuild, rather than a fork, but this module began on top of the work on [Weather Control](https://gitlab.com/jstebenne/foundryvtt-weather-control) by Julien St√©benne.  As I learned how to develop a module for Foundry VTT, having this as a solid starting point was invaluable.
