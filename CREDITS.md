## Used modules

### Simple Calendar

Simple Weather heavily relies on [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) by [Vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren). Without his incredible work handling date and time (which is known to be very hard to do in the programming world) and providing an API for it all, this module would be much harder to develop and maintain.

## Original Author

You can't easily tell, because this is a rebuild, rather than a fork, but this module began on top of the work on [Weather Control](https://gitlab.com/jstebenne/foundryvtt-weather-control) by Julien St√©benne.
