Some big changes:
- Reworked UI to shrink screen real estate by letting you toggle various control bars on/off based on your needs 
- Added first cut at weather effects; you can enable in the settings.  For now, only uses core scene weather functionality, but plan to add support for more sophisticated modules.

Added an option to hide the date/time box when using Simple Calendar (it's always hidden without it).  Helpful if you like to leave Simple Calendar open so only need the weather side of Simple Weather.

The initial public release.

- Intuitive UI to generate weather and see current time from Simple Calendar 
- Print the weather to chat, with the option of showing to players or not
- Choose whether players can see the dialog
- Generate weather for every new day automatically
- Randomized weather for every season across 3 climates (hot, temperate, cold) and 3 humidities (barren, modest, verdant)
- Weather progresses naturally from day to day
- Supports Farenheit and Celsius temperatures

As the GM you will also be able to change the current day in your game and add notes to days. Notes can be events or reminders and can be visible to players or just the GM.

The players are presented with a familiar calendar interface for switching between months and selecting days to see any notes on those days.
