The initial public release.

- Intuitive UI to generate weather and see current time from Simple Calendar 
- Print the weather to chat, with the option of showing to players or not
- Choose whether players can see the dialog
- Generate weather for every new day automatically
- Randomized weather for every season across 3 climates (hot, temperate, cold) and 3 humidities (barren, modest, verdant)
- Weather progresses naturally from day to day
- Supports Farenheit and Celsius temperatures

As the GM you will also be able to change the current day in your game and add notes to days. Notes can be events or reminders and can be visible to players or just the GM.

The players are presented with a familiar calendar interface for switching between months and selecting days to see any notes on those days.
